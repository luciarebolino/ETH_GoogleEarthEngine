Spectral Indexes - February 2025 

:globe_with_meridians: üõ∞Ô∏è
REMOTE SENSING

The following code snippets are designed as **interactive examples** to be used during the lecture. They will be demonstrated live, and participants will have the opportunity to engage with the code.  

In the **second part of the workshop**, we will **break down and explain each section of the code**

### Step 1: Satellites

- **Pixels** ‚Äì Understanding how satellite images are composed of discrete units of information.  
- **Orbits and Frequency** ‚Äì Exploring how satellites capture imagery at different time intervals and resolutions.

### Step 1: Spectrum and Indexes

- **Light** ‚Äì When light strikes an object, it can be absorbed, transmitted, or reflected. How this interaction happens and how it depends on the material properties of the surface?  
- **Bands** ‚Äì Combining bands - specific segments of the electromagnetic spectrum.
